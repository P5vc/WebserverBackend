<h3 style="text-align: center;">Priveasy VPN Installation Instructions</h3>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Thank you so much for choosing Priveasy VPN! Below you will find detailed instructions for installing the VPN on all different types of devices. Feel free to skip through the email to the section that applies to your device or preferred connection type.</p>
<p>To find and download the configuration files mentioned in these instructions, <a href="https://priveasy.org/#Login" target="_blank" rel="noopener">log in</a> to your account and then click on "VPN" in the menu at the top of the page. You may alternatively scroll down to the VPN section, located just after the Dashboard section on your account page. To download the files associated with each labeled device or connection type, click on the corresponding image.</p>
<p>Upon clicking on an image where more than one profile is available, you will first be asked which VPN profile you would like to download. Plan #2 will give you a choice between two different domestic profiles, whereas plan #3 will give you the choice between five different domestic profiles and five different offshore profiles, and will display four different connection credentials for our shadowsocks proxy. The offshore profiles may be used for activities that are prohibited while using our domestic VPN, such as torrenting and movie streaming.</p>
<ul>
<li>Mobile Apple Devices:
<ul>
<li>To install the VPN on an iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch, etc., you have two choices:
<ul>
<li>The recommended option is to use WireGuard. WireGuard is widely considered the best VPN protocol because of its speed and security. To use the WireGuard VPN, you must first install the WireGuard application. You may click <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wireguard/id1441195209?ls=1&amp;mt=8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> to download it for iOS/iPadOS. Once the app has been installed, click on the "Download Apple Device Profile" image under the VPN section at Priveasy.org, to download the WireGuard profile for your iOS/iPadOS device. You will now see a prompt that says "This website is trying to download a configuration profile. Do you want to allow this?". Choose "Allow". You will then see "Profile Downloaded - Review the profile in Settings app if you want to install it." Click "Close". Next, open your Settings application. At the top, you should see a tab that says "Profile Downloaded". Click on it. If you don't see this tab, you may instead click on the "General" tab, then click on "Profiles", then click on the profile that appears. Finally, a prompt should appear that says "Priveasy VPN". Choose "Install" in the top right corner. You will be prompted to enter your password. You will be asked again if you'd like to install the Profile. Choose "Install" twice more, and that's it! Congratulations, the VPN has now been installed!</li>
<li>If WireGuard is blocked on your network, or you need a more-covert connection, then you may wish to use our Shadowsocks proxy, instead of WireGuard. You may click <a href="https://shadowsocks.org/en/download/clients.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> to view a full list of client software. The application we recommend is <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/outline-app/id1356177741" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Outline</a>. To use this application, you must first download it, using the previous link. Next, click on the "View Shadowsocks Connection Information" image under the VPN section at Priveasy.org. Finally, copy the url starting with "ss://" for either our domestic or foreign server, and open the Outline app. The app will automatically prompt you to add the server, and allow you to connect. Please note: the v2ray plugin is not currently supported on mobile devices: that is why there is no mobile configuration URL under the v2ray plugin connection details.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Side note: The VPN is configured to automatically connect whenever you're using Wi-Fi or data. If you would like to be able to manually turn it on or off, deselect the option that says "Connect on Demand." On an iPhone that can be accessed by going to Settings&gt;General&gt;VPN, and then clicking on the "i" in the circle next to the VPN profile, or by editing the connection details from within the WireGuard app.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Android Devices:
<ul>
<li>Go to the Google Play Store and install WireGuard. You may also click <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wireguard.android">here</a> to download it. This is client software for the VPN. To set up a connection, save the WireGuard configuration file to your internal storage (download it by clicking on the image that says "Download WireGuard Configuration File" in the VPN section of your Priveasy account). Next, choose to "Add a tunnel" via a configuration file from within the WireGuard app (do not choose to add one by scanning a QR Code or creating one from scratch). Finally, select the configuration file that you downloaded and follow any of the prompts it may give you. Congratulations, the VPN has now been installed!</li>
<li>If WireGuard is blocked on your network, or you need a more-covert connection, then you may wish to use our Shadowsocks proxy, instead of WireGuard. You may click <a href="https://shadowsocks.org/en/download/clients.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> to view a full list of client software. The application we recommend is <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.outline.android.client" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Outline</a>. To use this application, you must first download it, using the previous link. Next, click on the "View Shadowsocks Connection Information" image under the VPN section at Priveasy.org. Finally, copy the url starting with "ss://" for either our domestic or foreign server, and open the Outline app. The app will automatically prompt you to add the server, and allow you to connect. Please note: the v2ray plugin is not currently supported on mobile devices: that is why there is no mobile configuration URL under the v2ray plugin connection details.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Windows/MacOS Laptops:
<ul>
<li>To install the VPN on Windows, first <a href="https://www.wireguard.com/install/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">download</a> and install the WireGuard application. Next, click on the image labeled "Download WireGuard Configuration File" in the VPN section of your Priveasy account, and save the file to your downloads folder. Finally, from within the WireGuard application, choose "import tunnel(s) from file", and then select the configuration file you just downloaded. Congratulations, the VPN has now been installed!</li>
<li>If WireGuard is blocked on your network, or you need a more-covert connection, then you may wish to use our Shadowsocks proxy, instead of WireGuard. You may click <a href="https://shadowsocks.org/en/download/clients.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> to view a full list of client software. Because installation instructions vary greatly, and every user may require a different setup, we recommend looking for OS-specific instructions online, especially if you wish to utilize the v2ray plugin. Using the Shadowsocks proxy is only recommended for our more-advanced users.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>GNU Linux
<ul>
<li>I cannot possibly cover all linux-based OS's, so I'll have to stick with installation instructions for the most-popular one instead: Ubuntu. That being said, I have found that the process is very similar, if not identical, for most of them, and I'm sure that there's lots of documentation online to help you with your specific operating system.
<ul>
<li>If you choose to use WireGuard (this is the recommended option), odds are it's already built into your OS's kernel, so no dkms will need to be installed. If not, then I recommend looking on <a href="https://www.wireguard.com/install/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WireGuard's website</a> for specific installation instructions. Most OS's will only require installing the "wireguard" and/or "wireguard-tools" packages, though. The next step is to click on the image labeled "Download WireGuard Configuration File" in the VPN section of your Priveasy account, and save the file to your downloads folder. Finally, you will want to create the /etc/wireguard/ directory if it doesn't already exist, and then copy (or move) the downloaded configuration file to that directory. The following command should work: "sudo mkdir -p /etc/wireguard &amp;&amp; sudo cp ~/Downloads/configFileName.conf /etc/wireguard/wg0.conf" (Note: replace "configFileName.conf" with the name of the configuration file that was downloaded; this command will change the name of the file to wg0.conf once it is copied to the /etc/wireguard/ directory for ease of use, and to follow the standards). Finally, although not necessary, you may wish to change the file permissions: "sudo chmod 600 /etc/wireguard/wg0.conf". Congratulations, the VPN is now set up! To activate it, you just need to run the command "wg-quick up wg0". When you wish to deactivate the VPN, run "wg-quick down wg0". Finally, if you wish to check on the status of the VPN, you may run "sudo wg".</li>
<li>If WireGuard is blocked on your network, or you need a more-covert connection, then you may wish to use our Shadowsocks proxy, instead of WireGuard. You may click <a href="https://shadowsocks.org/en/download/clients.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> to view a full list of client software. Because installation instructions vary greatly, and every user may require a different setup, we recommend looking for OS-specific instructions online, especially if you wish to utilize the v2ray plugin. Using the Shadowsocks proxy is only recommended for our more-advanced users.</li>
